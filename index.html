        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
          studying Computer Science and Mathematics. On this site, you can find
          my personal projects, finance visualizations, blog posts, and
          my academic work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics, I enjoy weightlifting, playing poker, and
          collecting Funko Pops. I also have a passion for videogames and have
          owned most consoles you could think of.
