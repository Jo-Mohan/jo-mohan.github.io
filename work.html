          My work for the <i>Card Tech: Machine Learning</i> team involved writing Python and Bash scripts to automate the cleanup of data pipelines and PVCs. During the company hackathon, I worked with team of interns to develop <i>Clarity</i>: a chrome extension that linked with Github to summarize large codebases using the <i>GPT-4 API</i>. This project won first place in the hackathon and is currently being evaluated for further development.

          I worked alongside Professor Angrave to research potential security vulnerabilities in code generated by AI models such as ChatGPT. We found that these models often produce code with common security flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
